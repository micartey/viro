## ðŸ“š Introduction

viro is a java overlay doodle application meant to quickly draw and highlight things in screen sharings or recordings.
It is implemented in JavaFx and builds on the Spring Boot framework.

### Architecture

Due to scalability and ease of development, an event-based architecture is being used.
Most parts are covered by the build-in event system of Spring Boot, some other parts are covered
by [jation](https://github.com/micartey/jation).
jation is being used to only execute events for the current selected brush.
It provides a possibility to add a filter before invoking a method, which checks if the brush is the selected brush.
The code can be
found [here](https://github.com/micartey/viro/blob/1a8fa0810a2b03d8fedd1727def66c3e9a417cc9/src/main/java/me/micartey/viro/input/MouseObserver.java#L49-L62).

### Development

*(Writing this for future me in order to not spend an entire evening to get this up and running)*

1. Create a `.sdk` folder
2. Download a [javafx-sdk](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) and extract it into the `.sdk` folder.
   The resulting structure should be: `.sdk/<your-fx-sdk>/lib`
3. Edit the Run configuration in your ide and add the following JVM flag

```
--module-path ./.sdk/<your-fx-sdk>/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics
```

4. Build the application with Maven. Make sure to skip tests

```shell
mvn package -B -DskipTests=true -f pom.xml
```

## Getting Started

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/micartey/viro/releases) and download the newest version of viro.
This can either be a commit or the latest stable version.
As both should work you can choose for yourself.

You also need to have a Java version newer or equal to Java 17.

### Shortcuts

There are some shortcuts you can use.
They are currently not configurable, but will be in the feature.
At the moment, the following shortcuts are pre-defined and static:
